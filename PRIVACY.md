Privacy Policy for Quick Launch Chrome Extension

Last Updated: May 29, 2025

Thank you for using Quick Launch (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in relation to the Extension.

**1. Information We Collect**

The Quick Launch Extension allows users to input and store website URLs they wish to access quickly. These URLs are actively provided by the user and are stored locally within the user's own browser through the `chrome.storage` API.

We DO NOT collect any other personally identifiable information (PII) apart from the URLs that the user voluntarily inputs into the Extension for its intended functionality. We do not collect names, email addresses, browsing history (other than the list of URLs you explicitly add to the Extension), or any other personal data.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

The stored URLs are used solely to enable the core functionality of the Extension. This means the URLs are used to:
*   Open the specified websites in new browser tabs when the user clicks the Extension icon or uses the configured keyboard shortcuts.
*   Display the list of URLs within the Extension's options page for management by the user.

**3. Information Storage and Security**

The URLs you provide are stored locally on your computer within your Chrome browser's local storage area, managed by the `chrome.storage` API. This data is NOT transmitted to any external servers, nor is it accessed by or shared with the developer of this Extension or any third parties. The security of this locally stored data is handled by your Chrome browser's security measures.

**4. Data Sharing**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer the URLs you store in the Extension, or any other data, to outside parties. The data remains local to your browser.

**5. User Control and Access**

You have full control over the URLs stored by the Extension. Through the Extension's options page, you can at any time:
*   Add new URLs.
*   Modify existing URLs.
*   Delete stored URLs.

**6. Children's Privacy**

The Extension is not directed at children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such information.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page or through the Chrome Web Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
